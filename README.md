👋 Hi, I’m Kauê Filipe, a software engineering student focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development.

👀 I’m interested in web development, artificial intelligence, and I plan to start learning backend development soon.

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also studying English to work in the technology field.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects, work with new technologies, and gain experience as a junior developer, even though I haven’t found my first job yet.
